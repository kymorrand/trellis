# Changelog

## 2026-03-27 — Dual-Capture Screenshot System (Sprint 7)

Display capture system using `mss` for physical monitor screenshots + dev-mode debug panel for triggering captures from the browser.

### Display Capture Module (`trellis/hands/display_capture.py`)

- **`capture_display(monitor)`** — Captures the primary display (or specified monitor index) using mss. Converts BGRA to RGB PNG via Pillow. Returns `DisplayCapture` dataclass with image bytes, dimensions, monitor info, and timestamp.
- **`list_monitors()`** — Returns all available monitors with dimensions. Index 0 is the virtual "all monitors" screen, index 1+ are physical displays.
- **`save_temp_screenshot()`** / **`cleanup_temp_screenshots()`** — Temp file management with configurable max file limit (default 50).

### API Endpoint (`POST /api/screenshot`)

- Request body (optional): `{"monitor": null}` to select monitor index.
- Response: base64-encoded PNG image with metadata (timestamp, display dimensions, monitor count).
- Runs synchronous mss capture in an executor to avoid blocking the async event loop.
- Returns 500 with error message on capture failure.

### Debug Capture Panel (Dev Mode)

- **`trellis/static/js/debug-capture.js`** — Self-initializing IIFE module. Creates a floating bottom-right panel with a "Capture for Ivy" button that POSTs to `/api/screenshot`. Shows capture metadata on success. Keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+S (Cmd+Shift+S on Mac). Only activates on localhost or with `?debug` param.
- **`trellis/static/debug-panel.css`** — Warm cream panel styling using oklch colors. Muted green capture button, smooth transitions, success/error states.
- All 5 HTML pages (`start`, `canvas`, `brief`, `inbox`, `garden`) include the debug panel.

### Dependencies

- `mss>=9.0.0` added to `[project.optional-dependencies] dev`

### Testing (`tests/test_display_capture.py`)

- 17 tests covering: list_monitors, capture_display, cleanup, save_temp_screenshot, and API endpoint.

## 2026-03-27 — Fix Screenshot Capture Timeout (SSE Stream)

`!screenshot` and `!screenshotnow` Discord commands failed with `TimeoutError` because Playwright's `wait_until="networkidle"` never resolves when the page has a persistent SSE connection (`/api/agent/state/stream`).

### Changes

- **`trellis/hands/screenshot.py`** — Changed `wait_until="networkidle"` to `wait_until="domcontentloaded"` in both `capture_screenshot()` and `capture_screenshot_live()`. Added a 1.5s post-goto render settle sleep so GSAP animations complete before the screenshot is taken.
- **`tests/test_screenshot_hand.py`** — Added tests verifying both functions use `domcontentloaded` wait strategy.

---

## 2026-03-27 — `!screenshotnow` Discord Command

On-demand live screenshot capture from the running Trellis web server, posted directly to a designated Discord channel.

### `capture_screenshot_live()` (`trellis/hands/screenshot.py`)

- **New function** — Captures a screenshot from the already-running Trellis web server (port 8420) via async Playwright. Unlike `capture_screenshot()`, this does NOT spin up a temporary server. Saves to `_ivy/screenshots/live-{timestamp}.png`. 15-second page load timeout with networkidle wait.

### `post_file_to_channel_id()` (`trellis/senses/discord_channel.py`)

- **New method** on `IvyDiscordBot` — Posts a file to a Discord channel by numeric ID. Uses `get_channel()` with `fetch_channel()` fallback. Handles NotFound and Forbidden gracefully.

### `!screenshotnow` Command (`trellis/senses/discord_channel.py`)

- **New Discord command** — Captures a live screenshot and posts it to channel `1487076264450981999` with timestamp and hostname metadata. Sends a confirmation to the source channel if different from the target. Error handling for server unreachable and Playwright failures.

### Testing (`tests/test_screenshot_hand.py`)

- 11 new tests: `capture_screenshot_live` (path format, port, viewport, page path, no temp server), `post_file_to_channel_id` (cached channel, fetch fallback, not-found handling), `!screenshotnow` command (capture + post flow, confirmation message, error handling).

---

## 2026-03-27 — Fix screenshot-to-Discord pipeline wiring

Three bugs prevented the screenshot validation pipeline from working end-to-end despite all individual components functioning correctly.

### Bug Fixes

- **Missing HeartbeatScheduler params** (`scripts/run_discord.py`) — Added `discord_post_file_callback`, `anthropic_client`, and `config` to the HeartbeatScheduler initialization. Without these, screenshot capture and vision validation were silently disabled at runtime.
- **Silent skip warning** (`trellis/core/heartbeat.py`) — When `anthropic_client` or `config` is not provided, the screenshot validation time window now logs a one-time warning instead of silently skipping. Makes the misconfiguration visible in production logs.
- **Screenshot image posted on success** (`trellis/core/heartbeat.py`) — Previously, successful validations only posted a text message. Now posts the actual screenshot image with caption in both success and failure cases via `discord_post_file_callback`.

### Testing

- **`tests/test_heartbeat.py`** — 5 new tests: skip warning fires when client missing, skip warning fires only once, success case posts image via post_file, failure case posts image, fallback to text-only when post_file unavailable.

---

## 2026-03-27 — Sprint 6: Discord Screenshot Posting & Vision Validation

Ivy gains screenshot capture, vision-based validation, and Discord file posting -- a full pipeline from UI capture to AI assessment to team communication.

### Screenshot Hand (`trellis/hands/screenshot.py`)

- **`capture_screenshot()`** — Async function that spins up a temporary Uvicorn server, uses async Playwright to navigate and capture, supports phase locking via circadian JS, and saves timestamped PNGs to `{vault_path}/_ivy/screenshots/`.
- **`capture_start_screen()`** — Convenience wrapper for capturing the Start screen at a specific circadian phase and viewport.
- **`validate_screenshot()`** — Sends a screenshot to Claude vision (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) with natural-language expectations, parses structured pass/fail response, tracks API cost.
- **`capture_and_validate()`** — Combined convenience function: capture then validate in one call.
- **`ValidationResult`** dataclass — `passed`, `summary`, `details`, `cost_usd`.

### Discord File Posting (`trellis/senses/discord_channel.py`)

- **`post_file()`** — Posts a file (image) to the primary channel with optional text message.
- **`post_file_to_channel()`** — Posts a file to a named channel by name.
- **`!screenshot [phase]`** command — Kyle types `!screenshot evening`, Ivy captures the Start screen at that phase, validates with vision, and posts the screenshot + validation summary to the channel. Shows typing indicator during capture.

### Heartbeat Integration (`trellis/core/heartbeat.py`)

- **`_screenshot_validation()`** task — Runs daily at 8:30 AM (after morning brief). Captures Start screen in "day" phase, validates layout/content, posts results to Discord. On failure, posts the screenshot image with details.
- **`discord_post_file_callback`** — New constructor parameter for file posting from heartbeat tasks.
- **`anthropic_client` / `config`** — New constructor parameters enabling vision API access from scheduled tasks.

### Testing (`tests/test_screenshot_hand.py`)

- 22 tests covering: ValidationResult dataclass, capture with mocked Playwright (path return, phase lock, no-phase skip, custom viewport), vision validation (JSON parsing, code fence handling, invalid JSON fallback, async wrapper), capture_and_validate integration, Discord file posting (primary channel, missing channel, named channel), !screenshot command handler, heartbeat scheduling (trigger at 8:30, skip without client, callback storage), viewport config.

---

## 2026-03-27 — Sprint 5: Screenshot Regression Testing

Visual regression testing infrastructure for the Trellis web interface. Captures screenshots across all circadian phases and viewport sizes, then compares against saved baselines to catch unintended visual changes.

### Screenshot Comparer (`trellis/testing/screenshot.py`)

- **`ScreenshotComparer`** class -- pixel-level image comparison with configurable diff threshold. Uses Pillow for image loading and comparison.
- **`CompareResult`** dataclass -- holds pass/fail status, diff ratio, pixel counts, and paths to baseline, current, and diff images.
- **Diff image generation** -- highlights changed pixels in red on a dimmed version of the baseline for easy visual identification.

### CLI Tool (`scripts/screenshot_test.py`)

- **`--baseline` mode** -- captures reference screenshots for all phase x viewport combinations (15 total: 5 phases x 3 viewports).
- **Validation mode** -- compares current screenshots against baselines, reports diff percentages, generates diff images for failures, exits with appropriate code (0=pass, 1=fail, 2=no baselines).
- **Filtering** -- `--phase` and `--viewport` flags for testing individual combinations.
- **Viewports** -- mobile (375x812), desktop (1440x900), kiosk (2560x1600 with `?kiosk=true`).
- **Circadian locking** -- uses `TrellisCircadian.lockToPhase()` to capture each phase deterministically.
- **Self-contained** -- starts web server programmatically via uvicorn in a thread, finds free port automatically.

### Phase Lock Dev Controls (`trellis/static/start.html` + `circadian.js`)

- **Dev panel overlay** -- floating panel with Dawn/Day/Afternoon/Evening/Night/Auto buttons. Visible with `?dev=true`, toggles with Shift+D.
- **Background gradient fix** -- `lockToPhase()` now sets `--bg-top` and `--bg-bottom` CSS vars (previously only set color palette + typography).

### Testing (`tests/test_screenshot_system.py`)

- 20 unit tests covering: identical image comparison, completely different images, partial diffs with correct ratio calculation, threshold boundary behavior (below/at/above/zero/high), diff image generation (valid PNG, red highlights, dimmed unchanged pixels, not generated on pass), missing baseline error handling, save_baseline operations, CompareResult dataclass fields.

### Dependencies Added

- `playwright>=1.40.0` (dev) -- browser automation for screenshot capture
- `Pillow>=10.0.0` (dev) -- image loading, comparison, and diff generation

## 2026-03-26 — Start Screen Readability for Kiosk Display

- **Viewport-scaled typography** on Start screen -- all text elements now use `clamp()` with `vw` units so they scale from 1080p to 2560x1600. Greeting renders at 80-120px on kiosk, date/clock at 32-48px, status at 24-32px, pathway titles at 28-36px, descriptions at 20-24px.
- **Container width unlocked** -- large-screen `max-width` increased from 560px to 720px so pathway cards have room to breathe on wide displays.
- **Vertical centering refined** -- hero padding reduced on large screens (`--space-4` top instead of `--space-8`) to place the greeting cluster at optical center.
- **Pathway spacing scaled** -- gap and padding use `clamp()` to grow proportionally on larger viewports.
- **`tabular-nums`** added to clock so digits do not shift as seconds tick.
- **`body.kiosk` class** -- CSS hook with ~20% size bumps on all key elements. Activated by `?kiosk=true` URL parameter for dedicated ambient display mode.
- **Nav and footer scaled** -- nav links and footer text use `clamp()` on large screens for proportional readability.

## 2026-03-26 — Start Screen Clock

- **Real-time clock** on Start screen -- displays `HH:MM:SS AM/PM` between the date line and Ivy's status indicator. Updates every second, uses the same Recursive mono font as the date for visual consistency. Animates in with the existing hero entrance.

---
## 2026-03-23 — Sprint 4: Inbox Interface Backend (MOR-31)

Ivy gains an intelligent inbox -- drop anything in, get classification, vault matching, urgency detection, and routing proposals with confidence scores. Kyle approves, redirects, or archives.

### InboxProcessor (`trellis/core/inbox.py`)

- **`InboxProcessor`** class -- the intelligence engine for content triage. Classifies content type (note/task/reference/question/idea/link/file), detects urgency (immediate/today/queue), matches against existing vault content, identifies best Ivy role (researcher/strategist/writer/organizer), and proposes a vault path with confidence score.
- **Confidence tiers** -- 90%+ green, 70-89% amber, <70% red. Confidence combines vault match strength, role detection clarity, and content type specificity.
- **Model-assisted classification** -- Uses `ModelRouter` when available for AI-powered classification; falls back to keyword heuristics when the router is unavailable or fails.
- **File-based storage** -- Items stored as YAML-frontmatter Markdown in `_ivy/inbox/items/`, same pattern as `queue.py`. Archived items move to `_ivy/inbox/archived/`.

### Inbox API Endpoints (`trellis/senses/web.py`)

- **`GET /api/inbox/items`** -- List pending items sorted by urgency then planted date, with counts (pending, today, immediate).
- **`POST /api/inbox/drop`** -- Accept content, run through InboxProcessor, return item with routing proposal.
- **`GET /api/inbox/{item_id}`** -- Full item detail including vault matches.
- **`POST /api/inbox/{item_id}/approve`** -- Approve routing, save content to proposed vault path.
- **`POST /api/inbox/{item_id}/redirect`** -- Override proposed path, save to specified location.
- **`POST /api/inbox/{item_id}/archive`** -- Move item to archived directory.

### Heartbeat Integration (`trellis/core/heartbeat.py`)

- **`_check_inbox()` rewrite** -- Now scans `_ivy/inbox/drops/` for unprocessed files, runs each through `InboxProcessor.process_drop()`, moves classified items to `_ivy/inbox/items/`, removes processed drop files, and logs results to journal.

### Testing (`tests/test_inbox.py`)

- 40+ tests covering: confidence tier mapping, serialization round-trips, heuristic classification (task/question/idea/link/note), model-assisted classification with mock router, model failure fallback, urgency detection (immediate/today/queue keywords), role detection (researcher/strategist/writer/organizer/default), vault matching, full process_drop pipeline, file storage operations (save/load/approve/redirect/archive), urgency sort ordering, and all 6 API endpoints (drop/list/detail/approve/redirect/archive) including 404 cases.

---

## 2026-03-23 — Self-Restart + Graceful Shutdown (MOR-29)

Ivy can now restart herself after code changes — no more manual `systemctl restart`.

### Self-Restart (`request_restart` tool)

- **`request_restart`** tool — Writes a trigger file (`_ivy/restart-requested`) that a companion systemd service picks up. Includes reason and timestamp. Writes `.startup_message` so Ivy announces she's back after restart.
- **`trellis-restarter.service`** — Companion systemd service (`scripts/trellis_restarter.sh`) that polls for the trigger file every 2 seconds and runs `systemctl restart trellis.service`.
- **Permission** — `service_restart` set to `Permission.ASK`. Every restart requires Kyle's approval via `!approve`.

### Graceful SIGTERM Handling (MOR-29)

- **Signal handlers** (`scripts/run_discord.py`) — Registers `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` handlers that trigger clean async shutdown. Discord bot disconnects, heartbeat stops, web server exits, all tasks cancelled. Target: <5s shutdown instead of 90s timeout to SIGKILL.

### Testing

- **`tests/test_restart.py`** — 7 tests: tool definition, schema, permission mapping, trigger file writing, startup message, empty/missing reason validation, timestamp format.

---

## 2026-03-23 — Sprint 3: Linear Integration in Morning Brief (MOR-19)

### Morning Brief — Linear Tasks

- **Linear section in morning brief** — When `IVY_LINEAR_API_KEY_MORRANDMORE` is configured, the 8:00 AM morning brief now includes active Linear tasks from the MOR team: total active count, top 3 priority items (sorted Urgent > High > Normal > Low > None), and any blocked items.
- **Graceful degradation** — If no Linear API key is configured, the section is silently skipped. If the Linear API call fails at runtime, the error is logged and the brief posts without the Linear section.
- **`HeartbeatScheduler.linear_client`** — New optional `LinearClient` parameter. `scripts/run_discord.py` creates and passes the client when the env var is present.

### Status Report Rewrite

- **Formatted output** — `get_status_report()` now returns markdown-formatted output with uptime, tick count, vault stats, and API spend breakdown instead of plain-text single-line metrics.

### Testing

- **`tests/test_heartbeat.py`** — 6 new tests for Linear morning brief integration (with client, without client, API failure graceful degradation, priority sorting, all-completed, blocked detection by state name). Status report tests updated to match new format.
- **`tests/test_queue.py`** (new) — 12 tests covering ApprovalQueue operations: add with/without tool fields, frontmatter serialization, backward compat, get/approve/dismiss, empty queue, multiple items.

---

## 2026-03-23 — MOR-28: Wire Linear Client into ReAct Loop

Ivy can now read and search the Morrandmore Linear board directly through the ReAct tool loop.

### Linear Tools (MOR-28)

- **`linear_read`** tool — Read issues from the MOR team board with optional limit parameter. Calls `LinearClient.get_team_issues()` and formats output via `format_issues()`.
- **`linear_search`** tool — Search Linear issues by text query. Calls `LinearClient.search_issues()` with configurable limit.
- **Permission mapping** — Both tools route to `linear_morrandmore_read` (ALLOW level in permissions table).
- **Graceful degradation** — Returns a helpful message when `IVY_LINEAR_API_KEY_MORRANDMORE` is not set. No crashes, no stack traces.
- **`ToolExecutor.linear_client`** — Initialized from env var at construction time. `None` when key is absent.

### Testing

- **`tests/test_linear_client.py`** — 12 new tests covering: tool definitions present in `TOOL_DEFINITIONS`, permission key mapping, `_linear_read` handler with mocked client (formatted output, default limit, no-client graceful failure), `_linear_search` handler with mocked client (formatted output, default limit, no-client graceful failure).

---

## 2026-03-23 — Fix claude CLI PATH for armando_dispatch under systemd

When Ivy runs under systemd, `armando_dispatch` failed with `claude: not found` because systemd's minimal PATH doesn't include `~/.local/bin/`.

### Changes

- **Path resolution** (`trellis/core/loop.py`) — `_armando_dispatch()` now resolves the full path to `claude` via `shutil.which()`, with a fallback to `/home/kyle/.local/bin/claude`. Returns a clear error if neither works.
- **systemd PATH** (`scripts/trellis.service`) — Added `Environment=PATH=...` line so `shutil.which` can find `claude` in the service environment.
- **Tests** (`tests/test_loop.py`) — 3 new tests: `shutil.which` resolution, fallback path, and not-found error message.

---

## 2026-03-23 — Auto-Select Single Queue Item for !approve / !deny

`!approve` and `!deny` no longer require an ID when there's only one item in the queue — they auto-select it. With zero items, they report the queue is empty. With 2+ items, they list them and ask Kyle to specify.

### Changes

- **`!approve` auto-select** (`trellis/senses/discord_channel.py`) — When called without an ID: 0 items → "Queue is empty", 1 item → auto-approve, 2+ items → list with IDs.
- **`!deny` auto-select** (`trellis/senses/discord_channel.py`) — Same pattern: 0 items → "Queue is empty", 1 item → auto-deny, 2+ items → list with IDs.

---

## 2026-03-23 — Catch-Up Command (MOR-25)

When Kyle types `!catch-up` in Discord, Ivy runs through the ReAct loop with a structured prompt that gathers real data: recent git history, latest reports, pending queue items. Always routes to cloud (force_cloud=True) so Ivy has tool access.

### Changes

- **`!catch-up` command** (`trellis/senses/discord_channel.py`) — New command handler after `!deny`, before vault save check. Sends a structured prompt through `_get_response()` with `force_cloud=True`. The prompt instructs Ivy to use `shell_execute` for git log and ls commands, and `vault_read` for the latest garden report. 120s timeout with graceful error handling. Sets agent state to "catching up" during execution.

---

## 2026-03-22 — Context-Aware Post-Tool Routing (MOR-26)

After Ivy makes a tool call or queues something for approval, Kyle's short follow-up ("yes", "do it") no longer misroutes to the local model.

### Changes

- **`RouteResult.used_tools`** (`trellis/mind/router.py`) — New `used_tools: bool` field on `RouteResult`. Defaults to `False`. Set to `True` by the ReAct loop when any tool calls were executed during the response.
- **ReAct loop tracking** (`trellis/core/loop.py`) — `_react_loop()` tracks `any_tools_used` flag, set on both normal completion and max-rounds fallback returns.
- **`force_cloud` routing override** (`trellis/core/loop.py`) — `AgentBrain.process()` checks `event.metadata["force_cloud"]`. When set, overrides `local` and `light` routes to `cloud`. Respects explicit `/local` and `/claude` prefixes (does not override `force_local` or `force_cloud` classifications).
- **Per-channel tool tracking** (`trellis/senses/discord_channel.py`) — `_last_response_had_tools` dict tracks whether each channel's last response used tools. On the next message, if the flag is set, passes `force_cloud=True` to `_get_response`, which propagates via `Event.metadata` to `AgentBrain`.
- **`_get_response` metadata** (`trellis/senses/discord_channel.py`) — Accepts optional `force_cloud` parameter, passes it through `Event.metadata` to the brain.

### Testing

- **`tests/test_loop.py`** — 7 new tests: `used_tools` flag set/unset/max-rounds, `force_cloud` overrides local, overrides light, does not override `force_local`, does not interfere with `force_cloud`.

---

## 2026-03-22 — Sprint 3b: Discord Approval Commands + Local Model Grounding (MOR-22, MOR-23)

### Discord Approval Commands (MOR-22)

- **Queue item format** (`trellis/core/queue.py`) — `add_item()` now accepts optional `tool_name` and `tool_input` parameters. Stored in YAML frontmatter so pending tool calls can be re-executed on approval. Backward compatible — existing items without these fields still parse correctly.
- **ToolExecutor wiring** (`trellis/core/loop.py`) — `_queue_approval()` now passes `tool_name` and `tool_input` to the queue when creating ASK-level items.
- **Discord commands** (`trellis/senses/discord_channel.py`) — Three new commands:
  - `!queue` — List pending approval items with IDs and summaries
  - `!approve <id>` — Approve item and re-execute the pending tool call, returning the result
  - `!deny <id>` — Deny item and move to dismissed/ without executing

### Local Model Grounding (MOR-23)

- **Strengthen local grounding** (`trellis/mind/soul.py`) — `load_soul_local()` now explicitly tells local models they have no tool access and directs Kyle to use `/claude` for action-requiring requests.
- **Route approval keywords to cloud** (`trellis/mind/router.py`) — Added `approve|approved|deny|denied|confirm|confirmed` to SONNET_KEYWORDS so approval-related messages always route to the cloud model with tool access.

### Testing

- **`tests/test_queue.py`** (new) — 12 tests covering tool_name/tool_input storage, frontmatter serialization, backward compatibility, get/approve/dismiss operations.
- **`tests/test_loop.py`** — Updated `test_ask_permission_with_queue` to verify tool_name and tool_input are passed through.
- **`tests/test_soul.py`** — 2 new tests: no-tool-access warning present, /claude redirect present.
- **`tests/test_router.py`** — 3 new tests: "approved", "deny that request", "confirm the dispatch" all route to cloud.

---

## 2026-03-22 — Sprint 3: Armando Dispatch Tool (MOR-21)

Ivy can now launch Armando (The Gardener) for development work — the bridge between Kyle's personal agent and his multi-agent dev team.

### Armando Dispatch (`armando_dispatch` tool)

- **Tool definition** (`trellis/core/loop.py`) — New `armando_dispatch` tool in TOOL_DEFINITIONS. Schema: `message` (string) + `project_dir` (string), both required. Description warns about 15-30 min runtime.
- **Handler** (`trellis/core/loop.py`) — `ToolExecutor._armando_dispatch()` validates inputs (non-empty message, non-empty project_dir, directory exists on disk), builds the `claude` CLI command with `--dangerously-skip-permissions --agent thorn -p {message} --max-budget-usd 5 --no-session-persistence`, calls `execute_command()` with 1800s timeout.
- **Permission** (`trellis/security/permissions.py`) — `armando_dispatch` set to `Permission.ASK`. Every dispatch requires Kyle's approval via the approval queue.
- **Shell timeout** (`trellis/hands/shell.py`) — `execute_command()` now accepts an optional `timeout` parameter (default 30s, backward compatible). Also added `"claude"` to `ALLOWED_COMMANDS`.

### Ivy Personality Revision (SOUL.md)

- **Personality** — "Be direct" moved to first line. Garden metaphors downgraded from personality trait to "seasoning — not the meal." Added honesty rule for knowledge gaps.
- **Response Quality** (new section) — Concrete over atmospheric. Answer the actual question. Short by default. Cite sources. Admit gaps. Banned filler phrases.

### Testing

- **`tests/test_loop.py`** — 8 new tests: tool definition presence, schema validation, permission key mapping, ASK permission check, empty message/project_dir validation, nonexistent dir validation, correct command construction (mocked), 1800s timeout passthrough.
- **`tests/test_shell.py`** — 2 new tests: custom timeout accepted, timeout expiry kills command.

---

## 2026-03-23 — Start Screen + Navigation Restructure

Trellis gets a proper front door. A new Start screen becomes the default landing page, and the Canvas moves to `/canvas`.

### Start Screen (`/`)

- **`trellis/static/start.html`** — New phone-first landing page with warm solarpunk aesthetic. Time-aware greeting (morning/afternoon/evening), live agent state via SSE, and intentional pathways to Canvas, Brief, and Garden with descriptions.
- Film grain overlay (feTurbulence at 30% opacity, multiply blend) on circadian-driven warm cream gradient background. Content floats directly on background — no transparent overlay boxes.
- GSAP entrance animations: staggered fade-up on nav, hero, pathways, and footer.
- Queue count badge on Brief pathway shows pending approval items.
- Circadian system initialized for time-of-day typography and color shifts.

### Navigation Restructure

- **All pages** updated with four-link nav: Start, Canvas, Brief, Garden (previously three links: Canvas, Brief, Garden).
- `/` now serves Start screen (was Canvas).
- `/canvas` now serves Canvas (was `/`).
- `/brief` and `/garden` unchanged.

---

## 2026-03-22 — Sprint 2: Semantic Search, Gardener Activity, Vault Health

Ivy gains semantic understanding of the vault, the runtime gets fully async plumbing, and Armando gets a face — the new `/garden` page shows what the dev team has been doing.

### Semantic Search Pipeline

- **Embeddings** (`trellis/memory/embeddings.py`) — Ollama `/api/embed` integration using nomic-embed-text (768-dim vectors). Async with httpx, 60s timeout, truncates at 32k chars, returns empty list on failure.
- **Vector Store** (`trellis/memory/vector_store.py`) — SQLite + sqlite-vec for cosine similarity search. `upsert()`, `search()`, `delete()`, `needs_update()` with content-hash dedup.
- **Hybrid Search** (`trellis/memory/knowledge.py`) — `KnowledgeManager` combines keyword search (30% weight) with vector search (70% weight), normalizes scores, deduplicates by path. Falls back to keyword-only when Ollama is down.
- **Context Assembly** — `auto_context()` now routes through hybrid search when `KnowledgeManager` is available. `vault_search` tool does the same. Both fall back to keyword-only gracefully.
- **Background Indexing** — Full vault indexed on startup as a non-blocking async task. Heartbeat reindexes every 6 hours. Unchanged files skipped via content hash.

### Runtime Integration

- **File Watcher** — `FileWatcher` wired as a concurrent async task in the main process alongside Discord bot, web server, and heartbeat. Monitors `_ivy/inbox/` for new files.
- **Async Vault Backup** — Nightly backup replaced inline `subprocess.run` with async `vault_backup()` from `trellis/hands/github_client.py` (uses `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` with pre-push secret scanning). Discord alerts on failure or exception.
- **Approval Queue Wiring** — `ApprovalQueue` connected to `ToolExecutor` and `AgentBrain`. When the permission system returns ASK, a queue item is created with tool name, input summary, and context instead of soft-denying. Works with or without queue (backward compatible).

### Kyle Context Model (MOR-20)

- **`load_kyle(vault_path)`** (`trellis/mind/soul.py`) — Loads `_ivy/kyle.md` at startup and appends to system prompt after SOUL.md. Kyle's professional context model — energy architecture, communication preferences, working methodology, relationship expectations.
- **`load_kyle_local(vault_path)`** — Condensed version for local models. Extracts only: Energy Architecture, Weekly Operating Framework, Communication Preferences, and What Ivy Should Know About the Relationship (contains Good/Bad/Great). Same grounding rule as `load_soul_local()`.
- **Discord + CLI** — Both senses load kyle.md at startup. Full version appended for Claude, condensed for Ollama. No changes needed in `AgentBrain` — receives the already-assembled prompt.
- kyle.md stays in `_ivy/` (excluded from vault search by design). Loaded explicitly, not discovered.

### Garden Page (`/garden`)

- **Gardener Activity** (`trellis/static/garden.html`) — 1920x1080 kiosk display showing Armando's development reports. Two-column layout: scrollable report list (left) + health sidebar (right).
- **Report cards** — Color-coded by agent: Root (`--color-leaf`), Bloom (`--color-wf-yellow`), Thorn (`--color-wf-red`). Agent tags as tinted pill badges. Grouped by date with Recursive Mono uppercase headers.
- **Garden Health card** — Sidebar card showing knowledge index stats from `GET /api/gardener/health`:
  - Index coverage bar (6px, GSAP-animated fill, color shifts: green >80%, yellow 50-80%, red <50%)
  - Four-stat grid: total files, indexed, stale, orphaned
  - Stale/orphan counts highlight in warn/danger when non-zero
  - Last-indexed timestamp in relative garden time
  - Gracefully hidden when endpoint returns 503 (standalone dev mode)
- **Empty state** — Plant SVG icon + "No reports yet. The garden is quiet."
- **Cross-page navigation** — Header nav links to Canvas, Brief, and Garden
- **GSAP entrance animations** — Staggered card fade-up (0.06s intervals), sidebar slides in from right, coverage bar fills after card appears

### Vault Health API

- **`KnowledgeManager.vault_health()`** — Returns total files, indexed files, stale files (not modified in 90+ days AND under 200 bytes), orphan files (no inbound `[[wikilinks]]`), last indexed timestamp, and index coverage percentage.
- **`GET /api/gardener/status`** — Returns Armando's development reports (status + garden reports) parsed from `_ivy/reports/`. Agent, type, and date extracted from filenames.
- **`GET /api/gardener/health`** — New endpoint exposing vault health stats. Returns 503 when knowledge manager is unavailable (standalone web dev mode).
- **Morning Brief** — Now includes vault health stats (file count, indexed, stale, orphans) when knowledge manager is available, with graceful fallback to simple file count.

### Testing

- **`tests/test_gardener_api.py`** — Tests for gardener status endpoint: empty reports, single status file, garden report, sorting, malformed filenames, fallback summary, missing vault path

### Dependencies Added

- `sqlite-vec>=0.1.6` — Vector similarity search extension for SQLite

## 2026-03-21 — Living Canvas: Design System + Web Interface

The Trellis design system and web interface go live. Ivy's heartbeat is now visible on Greenhouse's always-on display.

### Design System (`ivy-vault/projects/trellis/design-system/`)

- **DESIGN.md** — Master spec (11 sections): visual theme, OKLCH color palette, typography (Fraunces + Literata + Recursive Mono), spacing system, component stylings, circadian phases, agent states, garden metaphor rules, GSAP animation language, five interface definitions, anti-patterns
- **palette.md** — 15 color roles x 5 circadian phases, all OKLCH, with contrast validation rules and CSS keyframe interpolation patterns
- **typography.md** — Type scale (Major Third 1.25), variable font axis specs, circadian axis shifts, @font-face declarations
- **components.md** — 13 components (7 atoms, 5 molecules, 3 organisms) with 8-section Pandya specs
- **motion.md** — GSAP easing/duration tokens, 7 animation patterns, 24/7 display stability rules
- **states.md** — 5 agent states, 3 growth stages, 3 display modes with full animation specs
- **circadian.md** — SunCalc integration for Orlando FL, 4-layer implementation architecture
- **anti-patterns.md** — Impeccable base + 20 Trellis-specific rules + anchor image test

### Web Interface

- **FastAPI server** (`trellis/senses/web.py`) — Serves UI and 8 API endpoints
- **Living Canvas** (`/`) — 1920x1080 always-on display with real vault items, live agent state via SSE, approval cards, growth-stage SVG icons, warm cream background with film grain texture
- **Morning Brief** (`/brief`) — Phone-first layout with ScrollTrigger animations, real overnight activity, approval flow, garden stats
- **API endpoints** — `/api/status`, `/api/vault/items`, `/api/journal/recent`, `/api/agent/state`, `/api/agent/state/stream` (SSE), `/api/queue`, `/api/queue/{id}/approve`, `/api/queue/{id}/dismiss`, `/api/brief`
- **Shared JS client** (`trellis-api.js`) — Fetch wrappers, SSE connection, garden time formatting, growth-stage SVG generator

### Circadian System

- **circadian.js** — Inline SunCalc (no external dependency), generates CSS @keyframes for all 15 color roles + typography axes + background gradient. Zero runtime cost after injection.
- 5 phases (dawn/day/afternoon/evening/night) tied to real Orlando solar position
- Background gradient shifts from warm cream (day) to deep brown (night)
- Typography axes shift: Fraunces Softness + weight, Recursive Casual
- `TrellisCircadian.lockToPhase(name)` for testing

### Agent State Tracking

- **AgentState** (`trellis/core/agent_state.py`) — In-memory state with SSE subscriber queues
- Discord bot instrumented: idle -> thinking -> acting transitions visible on web in real-time
- 5 GSAP-animated states: idle (breathing), thinking (ripple), acting (bob), waiting (pulse), reporting (settle)

### Approval Queue

- **ApprovalQueue** (`trellis/core/queue.py`) — File-based queue using `_ivy/queue/`
- YAML frontmatter format, approve/dismiss moves to subdirectories (audit trail)
- Web UI renders cards with approve/dismiss animations, POST to API endpoints

### Infrastructure

- **Unified process** — `scripts/run_discord.py` now runs Discord bot + web server (:8420) + heartbeat as concurrent async tasks sharing state
- **Kiosk mode** — Chrome fullscreen on Greenhouse display, user-level systemd service with daily restart timer
- **Obsidian theme** — CSS snippet with Fraunces headings, Literata body, Recursive code, full warm palette (light + dark/Root Cellar)
- **Standalone dev server** — `scripts/run_web.py` for frontend development without Discord

### Dependencies Added

- `fastapi>=0.115.0`
- `uvicorn[standard]>=0.32.0`
